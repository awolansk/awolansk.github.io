	abstract = {A growing body of research has shown that many classiﬁers are susceptible to adversarial examples – small strategic modiﬁcations to test inputs that lead to misclassiﬁcation. In this work, we study general non-parametric methods, with a view towards understanding when they are robust to these modiﬁcations. We establish general conditions under which non-parametric methods are r-consistent – in the sense that they converge to optimally robust and accurate classiﬁers in the large sample limit.},
